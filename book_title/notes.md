# Book Title Kata

1. Take in a string argument that represents the title of a book.
2. The method should return a properly-capitalized string which represents the book title.
3. Certain words are only capitalized if they are the first word in the title: "a", "and", "the", "of".
4. If words, "a", "and", "the", "of" are not the first word in the title they should be lowercase.

>For example:
"lORd OF The riNGS" should be "Lord of the Rings"
"THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" should be "The Blair Witch Project"
"the bEaUtiful AnD The daMnEd" should be "The Beautiful and the Damned"
