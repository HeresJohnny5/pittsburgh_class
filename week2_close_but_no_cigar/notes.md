#Grand Bash Kata

**Exercise 2:**
* Write a function that takes **two numbers as strings**, and returns a **boolean**: true if they are off by one digit.
* eg if we pass '1234' and '1224' then the function should return true.
'1234' and '1325' should return false.

**Exercise 3:**
* Write a function that takes a **number (our ticket number) and an array of numbers (the winning numbers from all the draws). To start with, just restrict to all 4 digit numbers. Having the numbers as strings may make it easier to solve.**
* The function should **return an array of all the winning numbers that are one digit off from our ticket number.**
* eg our_number = '1234' and winning_numbers = ['9999', '5678', '1235', '1134', '1344'] should return ['1235', '1134']
* Make sure you have tests, and that you push to git after every test.
