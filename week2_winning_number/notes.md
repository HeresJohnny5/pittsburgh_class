#Grand Bash Kata

**Exercise 1:**
* Write a winning_numbers function.
* This function takes a **number** and an **array of numbers**, and returns a **boolean**: true if the number is in the array, and false if not.
* Should be test driven, with commits every test. A good first test could be a number and an empty array, which should return false.
